# Arduino Line Following Robot
This project is a sample of how to create a line following robot using an Arduino Uno, a L298N Dual Motor Controller and a pair of TCRT5000 IR Sensors. 

## Robot Base. 

The platorm for this project was a simple dual motor platform I found on Amazon. It is available from lots of places online, so pick from any of them. 

The motors seems to be about what you would expect from a 15 dollar amazon cheap platform. They have a bit of inital ristances that needs to be overcome.
